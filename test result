Based on the test results, I can see that your minishell has several areas that need improvement. Let me create a comprehensive list of the failing parts organized by category:

📋 Minishell Test Failure Analysis
🔧 Builtins Issues
Echo Command Problems:
Quote handling in echo - Tests 9-12: Fails to handle single quotes within double quotes and vice versa
Special character handling - Test 13: Wildcard expansion happening when it shouldn't (shows file listing instead of literal *)
Dollar sign handling - Tests 17, 19: echo "$" and echo $ should output $ but outputs nothing
Export Command Problems:
Debug output - Tests 24-32: Shows debug information that shouldn't be printed
Exit code handling - All export tests show "is gonna be freed" instead of proper exit codes
Error messages - Missing proper error messages for invalid identifiers
Multiple arguments - Doesn't handle multiple export arguments correctly


Unset Command Problems:
Error output - Tests 33-38: Shows "unset" error message when it should be silent

CD Command Problems:
Error handling - Tests 40-41: Wrong exit codes and missing proper error messages
Too many arguments - Should return exit code 1 with proper error message
Exit Command Problems:
Error messages - Tests 50-51: Wrong exit codes and different error message format


Empty Command Problem:
Parsing failure - Test 52: Should handle empty input gracefully



🔀 Pipes Issues
Grep with special characters - Test 55: Exit code mismatch
Export in pipeline - Test 56: Export doesn't work properly in pipelines



📁 Redirections Issues

Input Redirection Problems:
Basic input redirection - Tests 57, 60, 67, 68, 74: Input redirection not working properly
File with spaces - Test 62: Segfault (exit code 139) when handling files with spaces
Multiple input files - Test 58: Wrong behavior with multiple input redirections
Missing file handling - Tests 64-66, 76-80: Wrong exit codes and missing error messages


Output Redirection Problems:
All output redirection tests failing - Tests 81-131: Output is going to stdout instead of files
File permissions - Tests 85, 88-89, etc.: Wrong exit codes for permission denied
File with spaces - Test 86: Segfault when creating files with spaces in name
General Redirection Issues:
Pipe combinations - Tests 71, 73, 75: Wrong behavior when combining pipes with redirections
Error propagation - Many tests show wrong exit codes and missing error messages



🎯 Extras/General Issues

Command Execution Problems:
Variable expansion as commands - Tests 133, 135: Wrong exit codes when using variables as commands
File execution - Tests 136-146: All command execution tests fail with wrong exit codes and error messages
Permission handling - Wrong error messages and exit codes for permission denied
Missing commands - Should return 127 for command not found, but returns 0




Core Issues:
Exit code handling - Many commands return 0 when they should return non-zero
Error message format - Error messages don't match bash format
Memory management - Segfaults in file handling with spaces
Parsing - Empty command handling needs improvement

🏗️ Priority Fix Order:
High Priority: Exit codes, error message formatting, basic redirection functionality
Medium Priority: Quote handling in echo, export debugging output, command execution
Low Priority: Advanced redirection combinations, edge cases with special characters
The main systemic issues appear to be:

Redirection system completely broken (output going to stdout instead of files)
Exit code handling inconsistent throughout
Error message formatting doesn't match bash
Memory issues with file paths containing spaces
Command execution logic needs complete rework
